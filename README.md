#forum_member_interaction_analysis
A small script that goes throught a hiking forum (http://bpbasecamp.freeforums.net/), scrapes all the comments and replies and replies in a thread and then 
plots a visualisation graph of the most interacting users

result can be verified in "member interaction.png" file

it is clear that "dayhiker" has the most interaction with users
